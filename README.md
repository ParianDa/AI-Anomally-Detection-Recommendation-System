Anomaly Detection & Fraud Detection with TensorFlow and OpenAI This project performs anomaly detection on data uploaded from a React JS frontend, leveraging TensorFlow for anomaly detection and OpenAI for generating recommendations based on detected anomalies. The workflow includes data uploading, anomaly detection, and recommendation generation.

Prerequisites Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

Python: Version 3.7 or higher Node.js: Version 14.x or higher React JS: Installed for the frontend pip: Python's package manager to install dependencies OpenAI API Key: You'll need an API key from OpenAI (can be obtained from OpenAI). Setup Instructions 1. Clone the Repository Clone the repository containing the code to your local machine.

bash Copy git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/anomaly-detection-openai.git cd anomaly-detection-openai 2. Install Backend Dependencies The backend is written in Python and uses TensorFlow, OpenAI API, and other libraries. Follow the steps below to install the required dependencies.

a. Create a Python Virtual Environment (optional but recommended) bash Copy python -m venv venv

.\venv\Scripts\activate # For Windows b. Install Required Python Libraries Install the dependencies from requirements.txt:

bash Copy pip install -r requirements.txt Hereâ€™s a list of the core Python dependencies:

TensorFlow: Used for building and training the autoencoder model for anomaly detection. OpenAI: To interact with OpenAI API for generating recommendations. Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing (scaling and splitting). Matplotlib: For visualizations. PrettyTable: To format the output in a table. Pandas: For data manipulation. c. Set Up OpenAI API Key In the Python script, the OpenAI API key needs to be configured. Replace the openai.api_key in your script with your own OpenAI key.

python Copy openai.api_key = "your-openai-api-key" You can obtain the OpenAI API key by signing up for an account on OpenAI.

d. Install Additional Libraries (if needed) bash Copy pip install tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib pandas prettytable openai 3. Install Frontend Dependencies a. Navigate to the React JS Frontend bash Copy cd frontend b. Install Dependencies Make sure Node.js is installed. Then, install the React JS dependencies:

bash Copy npm install 4. Backend and Frontend Configuration Make sure both the backend and frontend are connected. You'll need to ensure the backend (Python API) is properly configured to receive data from the React JS frontend. The React JS frontend will send the uploaded file (e.g., CSV or JSON data) to the Python backend, which will process it and return the results.

You may need to set up CORS in your backend to allow communication between the React JS frontend and Python backend.

Start the Backend and Frontend a. Run the Python Backend bash Copy python app.py This will start the Python backend and expose an endpoint for receiving the uploaded data from the frontend and performing anomaly detection.
b. Run the React JS Frontend bash Copy npm start This will start the React JS frontend, and you should be able to open the app in your browser.

Running the Application Once the frontend and backend are running, you can:

Upload data (CSV or JSON format) from the React UI. The Python backend will process this data using an autoencoder model built with TensorFlow for anomaly detection. The backend will then use OpenAI's GPT model to generate recommendations based on the detected anomalies (fraudulent clicks, impressions, etc.). The results (including flagged anomalies and the generated recommendations) will be displayed in the UI. React JS Frontend Setup File Upload Interface: The React JS frontend should have a file upload interface where users can upload the data (in CSV or JSON format). Data Submission: Once the file is uploaded, it will be sent via an HTTP POST request to the backend API (in Python). Results Display: After the anomaly detection and recommendation process, the React frontend will display: A table showing the anomalies detected (fraudulent data). The recommendations generated by OpenAI based on the anomalies. You can modify the frontend to fit your specific UI/UX needs.

Python Backend Setup Receive Data: The backend (Python) will receive data from the frontend via an HTTP POST request. The data will be processed and used for anomaly detection. Anomaly Detection: The backend uses a TensorFlow model (autoencoder) to detect anomalies in the uploaded data. The reconstruction error of the autoencoder will be calculated to flag anomalies. OpenAI Recommendations: Based on the flagged anomalies, the backend will interact with the OpenAI API to generate recommendations on how to improve the campaign and prevent future fraudulent activities. Return Results: The backend sends the results (anomalies and recommendations) back to the frontend for display. Functionality Overview Data Upload: The user uploads data (e.g., clicks, impressions, device type, geolocation) via the React frontend. Preprocessing: The Python backend preprocesses the data (normalization, encoding categorical variables, etc.). Anomaly Detection: The backend runs an autoencoder model to detect anomalies in the data. Recommendation Generation: Based on the detected anomalies, the backend sends the data to OpenAI's GPT model to get recommendations. Display Results: The React frontend displays the results (detected anomalies and OpenAI recommendations). OpenAI API Key To make OpenAI API calls, you'll need an API key. You can get it from OpenAI. Add your API key to the Python script where indicated:

python Copy openai.api_key = "your-openai-api-key" Ensure you don't hardcode sensitive keys in production; consider using environment variables to store your API keys securely.

Troubleshooting CORS Issues: Ensure your backend API is configured to allow requests from your frontend. You can use the flask-cors library to handle this if you're using Flask. File Upload Errors: Make sure that the file format you're uploading (CSV/JSON) is correctly parsed and handled by the backend. API Errors: Ensure your OpenAI API key is valid and you are correctly sending the requests. If you encounter any issues, check the console logs for both the frontend and backend for more detailed error messages.
